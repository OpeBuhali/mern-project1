### üõ†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- **Limited Features**: The web is still in its early stages and lacks more advanced features like full-text search, comment systems, content moderation, and CRUD functionality.
- **Basic Authentication**: User authentication is functional, but could be enhanced with additional security measures like two-factor authentication or OAuth.
- **Performance**: As the number of articles grows, pagination might not be as efficient, and additional optimizations might be needed for larger datasets.
- **Design**: The design is minimalist and may not appeal to users who prefer more dynamic, feature-rich layouts.
- **XSS Protection**: While XSS protection is implemented, it's always possible for new vulnerabilities to be discovered. Continuous security updates are recommended.
